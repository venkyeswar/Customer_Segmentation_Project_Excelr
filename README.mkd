# Customer Segmentation Project

Welcome to the **Customer Segmentation Project**, an intensive group effort by six team members conducted during an internship at **AIVariant**. This project focuses primarily on exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, advanced machine learning models, and deep insights into customer behavior.

## Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to analyze customer data, perform in-depth clustering and classification, and derive meaningful customer segments. Our emphasis was on conducting detailed analysis and developing robust machine learning models while ensuring accurate insights.

### Key Features:
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Comprehensive analysis of the dataset using visualizations and statistical methods.
  - Uncovered patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data.

- **Clustering Techniques:**
  - Implemented **K-Means**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** to group customers.
  - Applied **PCA** and **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction and effective visualization of clusters.

- **Feature Engineering:**
  - Transformed raw data into meaningful features for model building.
  - Extensive preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and scaling of numerical data.

- **Classification Models:**
  - Built and compared multiple models, including:
    - **Logistic Regression**
    - **Decision Trees**
    - **Ensemble Models** (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
    - **Stacked Models**
    - **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
    - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
    - **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
  - Selected the **Stacked Model** to leverage the strengths of multiple algorithms for enhanced performance.

### Hard Work Highlights:
- Extensive **visualization analysis** to understand customer behaviors.
- Rigorous labeling of customers through iterative refinements.
- Model comparison and selection based on accuracy, precision, and recall.
